üö¶ Smart Traffic Light Simulation
A real-time traffic management simulation built with .NET 8 and Blazor Server that demonstrates intelligent traffic flow optimization using adaptive algorithms.
üéØ Features
‚ú® Core Features
Adaptive Traffic Control: Dynamic traffic light timing based on real-time vehicle density

Real-time Simulation: Live vehicle movement and traffic flow visualization

Smart Algorithm: Prioritizes directions with highest traffic congestion

Interactive Controls: Manual vehicle addition and simulation control

Visual Analytics: Live statistics and countdown timers

üöó Simulation Details
Four-direction Intersection: North, South, East, West

Vehicle Animation: Smooth movement during green lights

Dynamic Vehicle Management: Automatic addition and removal of vehicles

Real-time Statistics: Total vehicles, active road status, waiting queues

üõ† Technologies
Backend: .NET 8, C#

Frontend: Blazor Server, HTML5, CSS3

Styling: Custom CSS with animations

Architecture: Service-based with event-driven updates

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Prerequisites
.NET 8 SDK

Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

Modern web browser

Setup Steps
Clone the repository

Stop: Pause the simulation

Reset: Clear all vehicles and restart

Add Vehicle: Manually add cars to any direction using the '+' buttons

Simulation Behavior
Traffic lights automatically switch to the direction with most vehicles

Green light duration: 8 seconds minimum

Vehicles gradually move during green lights

Random vehicles are added to red-light directions

Real-time statistics update every second
üß† Algorithm
Intelligent Traffic Management
1. Monitor vehicle counts in all four directions
2. Identify direction with highest vehicle density
3. Exclude currently active green direction
4. Select new direction with maximum waiting vehicles
5. Activate green light for selected direction
6. Gradually reduce vehicles during green phase
7. Repeat process continuously
Key Algorithm Features
Minimum Green Time: Ensures fair distribution (3 seconds minimum)

Random Distribution: Handles equal vehicle counts

Real-time Adaptation: Responds to changing traffic patterns

Efficiency Focus: Reduces overall waiting time
